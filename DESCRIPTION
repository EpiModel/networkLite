Title: An Alternative Implementation of some of the `network` Package
    Functionality
Description: An implementation of *some* of the `network` package functionality
    based on a simplified data structure that is faster in some applications.
    Primarily intended for back-end use in `statnet` and `EpiModel` packages;
    the implementation is subject to change without notice. Supports binary and
    weighted, directed and undirected, bipartite and unipartite networks;
    does not support multigraphs, hypergraphs, or loops.
