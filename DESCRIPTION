Title: An Simplified Implementation of the `network` Package Functionality
Description: An implementation of some of the core network package functionality based on a 
    simplified data structure that is faster in many research applications. This package is designed 
    for back-end use in the statnet family of packages, including EpiModel. Support is provided for
    binary and weighted, directed and undirected, bipartite and unipartite networks; no current 
    support for multigraphs, hypergraphs, or loops.
